                    delegate to the arbitrator the authority to determine the arbitrability of any Dispute, including the scope,

                <p className={style.p}>
                    You may begin an arbitration proceeding by sending a letter requesting arbitration to the Company. You agree that the
                    arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration
                    Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available on the AAA’s website{' '}
                    <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org,</a> or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879. In the event the AAA is
                    unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider. Payment of all
                    filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s applicable rules. The Company will reimburse
                    those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 if the arbitrator rules in your favor on any material aspect of your
                    claim. The Company waives its right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration. However, if your claim is deemed
                    by the arbitrator to be frivolous or brought in bad faith or with an improper purpose, as measured by the standards of
                    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, then the arbitrator may award the Company the reimbursement of its costs and
                    arbitration fees against you and/or your counsel. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based
                    on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. You further
                    agree that if your arbitration claim is filed at or around the time of other similar claims by the same or related

                    In lieu of arbitration, either you or the Company may bring any individual claim in small claims court consistent with
                    the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. You
                    further agree that if your arbitration claim is filed at or around the time of other similar claims by the same or
                    related counsel, you agree that your

                    This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the
                    Federal Arbitration Act. The terms of the Arbitration Agreement provisions shall survive after this Agreement terminates
                    or your use of the Sites ends. Except as set forth above, if any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid
                    or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement.

                    All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the Dispute with the same
                    remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other customer.{' '}
                    <strong>
                        You and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their
                        respective individual capacities and in so doing you and the Company hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to
                        assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration (either as a named-plaintiff or class
                        member), and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of
                        any kind.{' '}

                    cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any
                    arbitration.

                    With the exception of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall survive the termination of these terms, these terms are
                    effective unless and until terminated by either you or the Company. You may terminate this Agreement at any time. The
                    Company also may terminate this Agreement at any time without notice, and accordingly may deny you access to the Sites,
                    if in our sole judgment you fail to comply with any term or provision of the Agreement. The obligations and liabilities
                    of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this Agreement for all purposes.

                    continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company
                    to assert a right or provision under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or

                    such that the remaining provisions of the Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect.
