                        on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our
                        emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open
                        or click an email, pixel tags, and web beacons generate a notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and
                        improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our
                        promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our affiliates and/or
